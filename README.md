# Plummet

This project aims to look at interop between Roughtime clients and servers,
providing the means to run both against each other.

## Development and Running

You'll need Docker as well as [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) installed.
To get started, clone this repository, then run:
```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
```

You can then run `poetry run plummet -h` to see the help information.
