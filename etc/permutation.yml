#          _            This file forms as the configuration runtime for
#        ,/_\,          testing each permutation of roughtime server and
#      ,/_/ \_\,        client. Somewhere in between we packet capture
#     /_/ ___ \_\       the server interface using netshoot and tcpdump.
#    /_/ |(V)| \_\
#      |  .-.  |        There's quite a lot of environment variables that have
#      | / / \ |        to be set here, including:
#      | \ \ / |        * SERVER_IMAGE - Name of the roughtime server
#      |  '-'  |        * CLIENT_IMAGE - Name of the roughtime client
#      '--,-,--'        * PCAP_FILE    - Filename (not path) of the pcap
#  jgs    | |           * PERM_DIR     - Folder where the permutation keeps
#         | |                            all outputted files, like the pcap,
#         | |                            but also logs and anything else
